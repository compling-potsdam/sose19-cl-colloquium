Title: Perceptual semantics and dialogue processing

Abstract: This is a preliminary investigation into utterances with perceptual meanings that refer to situations that are not perceptually available at the time of utterance. We sketch a formal account of the meanings of such utterances and how they relate to perceptual takes on the situations they refer to. We also outline dialogue protocols for dealing with assertions of this kind. As a theoretical framework we use the information state update approach couched in TTR, a Type Theory with Records.
