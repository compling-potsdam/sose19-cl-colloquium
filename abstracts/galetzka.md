# Week 09: Fact- and Attitude-Triggered Non-Goal-Driven Chatbots

Speaker: Fabian Galetzka (Uni Potsdam / VW Research)

### Abstract
Fully data driven Chatbots for non-goal oriented dialogues have several known issues like an inconsistent or uncontrollable personality and the missing ability to use knowledge within a conversation. One reason is the relative lack of labeled data from which personality consistency and facts could be learned together with dialogue behaviour. To address this, we built a new dataset in the domain of movies, where every dialogue is based on pre-specified facts and attitudes. We explored an end-to-end trained self-attention decoder model for training. It was judged to be natural and knowledgeable, but performed less well with respect to the attitudes. Therefore we want to augment the architecture in the future with external memories. These memory networks can store both, the general knowledge and related attitudes encoded as knowledge triples or full sentences.
