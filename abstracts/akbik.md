Title: The Flair Framework for State-of-the-Art Natural Language Processing

Abstract:

In the talk I will:

- Illustrate how we use transfer learning from neural language models to derive a new type of word embeddings (called "Flair embeddings")
- Discuss the difference of these embeddings vis-a-vis traditional embeddings such as GloVe or FastText
- Show how we use these embeddings to establish the current state-of-the-art in named entity recognition (NER) and other NLP tasks
- Introduce the open source "Flair framework for state-of-the-art NLP" that is now in use across hundreds of projects and companies
