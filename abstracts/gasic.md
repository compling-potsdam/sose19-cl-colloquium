# Milica Gašić, Deep learning for natural dialogue modelling

Abstract: Deep learning has made a revolution in machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision. In this talk, I will explain how deep learning can help solve some of the problems that dialogue modelling is facing, bringing us closer to models of natural conversation.  These include: scalable belief tracking, policy optimisation for large action spaces, and data-driven user modelling. I will also briefly talk about the ways to address the problem of evaluation of dialogue systems.

Bio: Milica Gasic is a professor at Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf and holds chair for Dialog Systems and Machine Learning. Prior to that she was a Lecturer at the Cambridge University Engineering Department. She has a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Belgrade (2006), an MPhil in Computer Speech, Text and Internet Technology (2007) and a PhD in Engineering from the University of Cambridge (2011). The topic of her PhD was statistical dialogue modelling and she was awarded an EPSRC PhD plus award for her dissertation.  She has published around 60 journal articles and peer reviewed conference papers and received a number of best paper awards. Most recently she obtained an ERC Starting Grant and an Alexander von Humboldt award. She is an elected member of IEEE SLTC and appointed board member of Sigdial.
