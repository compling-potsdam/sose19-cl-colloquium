Title: Shipping applied research in conversational AI

Abstract:

The number of software developers interested in developing chatbots and voice assistants is increasing rapidly. When engineers use a software library to build a product, they have very different needs from experts doing research. I will talk about our open source framework Rasa, and how we aim to give all developers the tools to build great AI assistants by doing applied research and shipping it into well-tested and documented tools, and serving a growing community when NLP research is moving so fast.
